# TASK DESCRIOTON:

  Project Title:
# Ride Sharing App Prototype with Location Tracking, Ride Requests, and Driver Information

üî∏ Description:
This project involves building a prototype of a Ride Sharing mobile application that allows users to request rides, track locations in real-time, and view driver details. The app uses Google Maps SDK for map integration and Firebase for real-time backend functionality including authentication, database, and location updates.

The goal is to create a basic but functional ride sharing system similar to apps like Uber or Ola, focusing on the core features needed to demonstrate the flow between a rider and a driver.

‚úÖ Core Features:
1. Location Tracking (Google Maps SDK):
The app uses Google Maps SDK to:

Show the current location of the user and driver.

Display pickup and drop-off locations.

Enable real-time tracking of the ride on the map.

2. Ride Requests:
The user can:

Select a pickup and destination location (via map or address input).

Send a ride request which is stored in Firebase.

Get updates when a driver accepts the request.

3. Driver Details:
Once a driver is assigned:

The rider can view the driver's name, vehicle details, contact number, and location.

A profile image and rating (optional) can also be shown.

4. Firebase Integration:
Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore stores:

User data

Ride requests

Driver responses and status

Firebase Authentication handles login/sign-up via email or phone.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional) can be used for notifications (e.g., "Driver has accepted your ride").

üó∫Ô∏è How It Works:
User Flow:

User opens app ‚Üí map displays current location.

User enters pickup & destination ‚Üí submits request.

System searches for nearby driver (simulated in prototype).

Driver accepts request ‚Üí app shows driver‚Äôs details and location.

Driver Flow (Optional Driver App or Admin Simulated):

Driver views pending ride requests.

Accepts a request ‚Üí status changes in Firebase.

Starts ride ‚Üí live tracking on rider‚Äôs screen.

üì¶ Technologies Used:
Frontend (Android App in Kotlin or Java):

Google Maps SDK

FusedLocationProviderClient for GPS

Material Design UI components

Backend (Firebase):

Firebase Authentication

Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore

Firebase Storage (for profile images)

(Optional) Firebase Cloud Messaging

üéØ Deliverable:
A working prototype ride-sharing app that:

Uses Google Maps SDK for real-time map tracking.

Uses Firebase for backend services like ride requests, driver data, and authentication.

Allows a basic flow of requesting rides, tracking location, and viewing driver details.

üßë‚Äçüíª Scope for Extension (Future Features):
In-app chat or call between rider and driver.

Estimated fare calculation.

Payment gateway integration.

Trip history for both riders and drivers.

Admin panel for managing users and rides.

This project is a great demonstration of combining location services, real-time databases, and map-based UI to build modern, scalable, and interactive mobile applications. It‚Äôs perfect for showcasing skills in Android development, Firebase integration, and map-based service apps.
